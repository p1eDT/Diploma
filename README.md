## Tech Stack

The solution uses a number of nuget packages:

[Allure.NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Allure.NUnit/2.9.5-preview.1) - NUnit attributes extenstions for Allure

[Faker.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Faker.Net) - C# port of the Ruby Faker gem (http://faker.rubyforge.org/) and is used to easily generate fake data: names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.

[NLog](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLog) - NLog is a logging platform for .NET with rich log routing and management capabilities. NLog supports traditional logging, structured logging and the combination of both.

[NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit) - NUnit features a fluent assert syntax, parameterized, generic and theory tests and is user-extensible.

[RestSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp/110.2.1-alpha.0.10) - Simple REST and HTTP API Client

[Selenium.WebDriver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.WebDriver) - Selenium is a set of different software tools each with a different approach to supporting browser automation.


And different approaches to developing frameworks and tests:

Driver Factory
Browser
Page Object
Page Steps
Wrappers
Builder for model
Chain of invocation
Faker
